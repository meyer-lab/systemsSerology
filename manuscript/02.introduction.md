While systems serology measurements include a variety of different assays to quantify humoral response, we recognized an overall structure to the data. The vast majority of the measurements quantify the extent to which an antibody bridges all pairs of target antigen and receptor panels, across a set of individuals. This, therefore, can be thought of as a three-dimensional dataset, where every number in this cube of data represents a single measurement. Then, separately from these measurements, some antigen-generic properties of the humoral response are assessed. In most cases these include a panel of measurements to quantify various glycosylation forms.
