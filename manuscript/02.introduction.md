## Introduction

A suite of recent technologies promise to broaden our view of humoral immunity much like the microarray did so for gene expression.

- Significance of systems serology
- Structure of the measurements
- Structure is key
    - Tensor factorization
    - What's lacking in other methods

While systems serology measurements include a variety of different assays to quantify humoral response, we recognized an overall structure to the data. The vast majority of the measurements quantify the extent to which an antibody bridges all pairs of target antigen and receptor panels, across a set of individuals. This, therefore, can be thought of as a three-dimensional dataset, where every number in this cube of data represents a single measurement. Then, separately from these measurements, some antigen-generic properties of the humoral response are assessed. In most cases these include a panel of measurements to quantify various glycosylation forms.







In this work, we use the structure of systems serology measurements to improve its visualization and use for predicting functional immune features. We first identify that systematic errors in the measurements can be corrected for improved normalization. Having corrected these measurements, we then develop a novel tensor factorization approach—total matrix-tensor factorization (TMTF)—to decompose these measurements into consistent patterns across patients, immunologic features, and antigen targets. Inspecting these factors reveals interpretable patterns in the humoral response, and these pattern's abundance across patients can predict functional immune responses and patient's grouping based on their control of HIV infection. This data-driven approach therefore provides a general strategy for systems serology analysis.
