![**Quantifying TAMR and ligand expression in human macrophage subtypes.** (A) THP1 cell line can be differentiated into macrophages by PMA and then to specific polarized subtypes via cytokines and stimuli (M0 - no stimuli, M1 - LPS/IFNg, M2 - IL-4/IL-13) (B) Brightfield images were documented to confirm cell morphologies for each cell population were assayed by multiplexed luminex ELISA against standard curve to determine receptor expression per cell of AXL (C) MERTK, and (D) TYRO3. (E) For each cell population GAS6 and PROS1 were assayed for their presence in both the (F) cell lysate and (G) media compartments. The percent of expressed ligand per compartment (lysate or media) was calculated for both (H) GAS6 and (I) PROS1. (J) Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to separate each of the four cell populations by their (K) loadings of TAMR and ligand expression (accounting for localization).](figure1.svg "Figure 1"){#fig:quantFig width="100%"}
