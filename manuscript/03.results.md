### Systems serology measurements can be drastically reduced without loss of information

We first sought to determine whether recognizing the structure of systems serology measurements could inform better data reduction strategies (Fig. @fig:cartoon). To integrate antigen-specific and -generic measurements, we developed an adjusted form of tensor factorization we will refer to as total coupled matrix-tensor factorization (TMTF) (Fig. {@fig:cartoon}C). By concatenating both the tensor and matrix during the alternating least squares (ALS) solve for the subject dimension, we maximize the variance explained across both datasets (Fig. {@fig:cartoon}D). This is in contrast to coupled matrix-tensor factorization, which only explains the variance shared between the datasets [@PMID:31251750] (Fig. {@fig:cartoon}D).

Antigen-specific measurements can be arranged in a three-dimensional tensor wherein one dimension indicates each subject, antigen, and receptor, individually. In parallel, antigen-generic measurements such as quantification of glycan composition can be arranged in a matrix with each subject along one dimension, and each glycan feature along the other. While the tensor and matrix differ in their dimensionality, they share a common subject dimension. C) Factorization. D) Venn diagram of the variance explained by each factorization method. Canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition can explain the variation present within either the antigen-specific tensor or glycan matrix on their own. CMTF allows one to explain the shared variation between the matrix and tensor. In contrast, here we wish to explain the total variation across both the tensor and matrix. This is accomplished with TMTF.](images/schematic.svg "Figure Cartoon"){#fig:cartoon width="100%"}

To determine the extent of data reduction possible, we examined the reconstruction error upon decomposition with varying numbers of components (Fig. {@fig:compress}A). As we start with a tensor of 181✖️22✖️41 and matrix of 181✖️25, we start with 168,000 total measurements. 43% of these are missing, meaning that in fact the original dataset contains 96,000 total measurements. After factorization with 6 components, we are left with four matrices of 181x6, 22x6, 41x6, and 25x6. Therefore, we reduce the dataset to 1.7% of the size (1,614 numbers), while preserving 90% of its variation (Fig. {@fig:compress}A). We compared this to the dimensionality reduction possible with PCA and the data organized in a flattened matrix form (Fig. {@fig:compress}B). TMTF consistently led to a similar accuracy on reconstruction with half the resulting factorization size compared to PCA (Fig. {@fig:compress}B). For example, TMTF led to a normalized unexplained variance of 0.15 at ~1,024 values within the factorization, while PCA required ~2,048 to do the same. This gave us confidence that this structured factorization can greatly reduce the data while preserving its meaningful variation.

### Factorization accurately imputes missing values

With confidence that factorization was reconstructing consistent patterns within the HIV serology response, we wondered if our approach might improve missing values imputation. Systems serology measurements require a panoply of different measurements in combination; especially in such large-scale efforts, measurements can be missing for a variety of reasons. Subject samples can be limited, and so only be available for a small set of measurements. A subset of measurements may be of particular interest to investigators; for example, surface antigens to a virus may be prioritized for more detailed Fcγ receptor binding measurements, since they are more likely to be exposed in the extracellular space. Effective imputation also allows for outlier detection, for example to identify assays that may have technical problems. Finally, observing that factorization accurately imputes missing values further supports that this approach identifies biologically-meaningful and consistent patterns.

To evaluate whether factorization could accurately impute missing values, we artificially introduced missing values by randomly removing receptor-antigen pairs throughout the entire dataset. TMTF was then performed which effectively filled these in, and we then calculated the variance inferred in this left-out data (Fig. {@fig:impute}A). Factorization imputed these values with similar accuracy to the variance explained within observed measurements (Fig. {@fig:compress}A), supporting that it is able to identify meaningful patterns even in the presence of missing measurements. This provides additional evidence that the patterns identified through factorization are a meaningful and substantial representation of the data.

### Factor components represent consistent patterns in the HIV humoral immune response

Systems serology measurements have typically been assessed through regularized methods, such as elastic net and partial least squares regression, on the measurements themselves [@DOI:10.15252/msb.20177881; @DOI:10.1016/j.cell.2015.10.027]. These methods are very effective at prediction, and do provide some interpretation of the mechanism behind those predictions. However, a measurement-centric perspective can hide that immune responses occur through polyclonal responses across antigens and through regulatory changes that affect multiple receptors. Systems serology measurements further complicate interpretation due to the nature of the measurements, which are affected by the product of both antigen binding and immune receptor interaction differences [@PMID:29268769].

In contrast, tensor factorization provides a much more interpretable view of the coordinate changes along these dimensions (Fig. @fig:factors). To visualize the resulting factors, we plotted all of the components along their subject (Fig. {@fig:factors}A), receptor (Fig. {@fig:factors}B), antigen (Fig. {@fig:factors}C), and glycan (Fig. {@fig:factors}D) factors. Notably, these factors quantitatively visualize the totality of the measurements, which has not been possible to date. To interpret the resulting plots, one can examine the values of an individual component along each plot, as each component represents a separate pattern of variation within the data (additively separable variation).

Through inspection of each individual component, one can understand the consistent patterns across the serology measurements. For example, component 4 explains a pattern of variation in specifically IgG1 (Fig. {@fig:factors}B), which occurs mostly for antigen binding to p51 and p66 (Fig. {@fig:factors}C). The amount of this p51/p66 IgG1 varies according to each subjects component 4 value (Fig. {@fig:factors}A). Finally, variation along this component corresponds to variation in glycan composition, most prominently a decrease in G1F and G1 overall (Fig. {@fig:factors}D). As each component is additively independent, they can be inspected on a component-by-component basis to explore every pattern of variation within the serology.

### Structured data decomposition accurately predicts functional measurements and subject classes

With confidence that our approach to data decomposition led to accurate data reduction, we evaluated whether our reduced factors could predict the functional responses of immune cells and subject classes. As a baseline of comparison, we reimplemented the immune functionality and subject predictions previously applied to this data [@DOI:10.15252/msb.20177881]. We observed similar performance to that reported (Fig. @fig:prediction). Differences could be explained by corrections we made to the cross-validation strategy to prevent over-fitting (see methods).

Next we benchmarked the ability of the factorized results to make these same predictions. TMTF represents the variation among subjects within a subject matrix (Fig. {@fig:factors}A). To make predictions, one needs only work with these subject factors rather than the hundreds of original variables in the entire dataset. Furthermore, TMTF provides factorization results for each subject despite the presence of missing values. We therefore were able to use all 181 subjects for the purposes of predicting each subject's features.

Particularly as we observed systematic, non-linear trends between the genotype-specific and -generic measurements across antigens (Fig. @fig:binding), we surmised that there might be a non-linear relationship between our factors and each prediction. Greatly reducing the number of variables allowed us to apply a Gaussian process model to predict each function and subject class, allowing for non-linear effects [@ISBN:0-262-18253-X]. We separated our quantification of model accuracy based on whether a subject was included or excluded within previous studies [@DOI:10.15252/msb.20177881].

Broadly, we saw a consistent improvement in our ability to predict immune functional responses (Fig. {@fig:factors}A). This was also the case for predicting whether subjects were classified as progressors or were viremic (Fig. {@fig:factors}B). Most impressively, the previously excluded cases, for which missing values were more abundant, were predicted with similar or better accuracy to those previously included (Fig. {@fig:factors}A/B). Therefore, data reduction can help to improve predictions of immune function response and of subject's clinical features.

### Immune function correlates match biological mechanisms 

ADCD was most prominently predicted using components 2, 5, and 8 (Fig. {@fig:import}A). The mechanistic importance of component 2 is clearly identified by its heavy weighting of LCA, PNA, and SNA binding, indicative of lectin-pathway complement activation (Fig. {@fig:factors}B) [@PMID:26082779]. Component 5 carried the strongest weight for C1q binding and so likely indicates classical pathway activation [@PMID:26082779]. As expected given galactosylation has been observed as the most predictive glycan form of C1q deposition [@DOI:10.3389/fimmu.2017.00877], component 5 also strongly weighted various galactosylation forms (Fig. {@fig:factors}D).

ADCC was clearly predicted through negative associations with components 3 (negatively), 4, and 6 (Fig. {@fig:import}A). Component 6 represents broad antigen binding across both gp120 and gp140, along with differences between the genotype-specific and -generic receptor measurements (Fig. {@fig:factors}B/C). Broadly, the receptor profile seems to negatively weight more sensitive receptor measurements, and positively weight those that were less sensitive (Fig. {@fig:binding}). Therefore, this component likely represents high avidity antigen binding which overcomes the lower sensitivity of the positively-weighted receptor measurements.

Antibody-dependent neutrophil-mediated phagocytosis (ADNP) was most prominently explained by components 2, 3, and 6 (Fig. {@fig:import}A). These higlight two mechanisms of driving neutrophil phagocytosis—via lectin engagement (components 2 and 3) and/or high-avidity FcγR binding (component 6).

All three cytokines most prominently depended upon component 6 (Fig. {@fig:import}A). As discussed above, this component likely represents high-avidity binding across surface antigens, and so its role in these responses is to be expected. Further, we might expect similar models across these cytokines as their amounts are highly correlated across subjects. Overall, our model interpretation supports that the decomposed factors identify relevant patterns in the serological responses.

### HIV progression and viremia occur through multi-antigen responses

The clinical properties of a disease likely involve multiple immune functions. As a result, being able to reason about a small number of consistent immunological patterns might be especially helpful for interpreting predictive models. Therefore, we took a similar approach for evaluating the variable dependence for predictions of subject progression and viremic status.

Remarkably, progression was exclusively explained by the single component 5 (Fig. {@fig:import}B). Component 5 corresponds to increased amounts of p24 binding across both HXBc2 and IIIb strains. Abundance of p24 antigen and its antibody titer has been proposed as an effective marker of HIV progression [@PMID:11118855], and predictive of death [@PMID:11109648], although much of this is via correlation with viral RNA and CD4+ counts [@DOI:10.1086/322045]. This component also displays negative weighting across gp120 and gp140 antigens, likely reflecting a decrease in antibody titers overall [@PMID:8118788]. Therefore, while features of p24 abundance or antibody titers may have a complex relationship with progression, an increase in p24 titer alongside a decrease in viral titers overall may be more predictive of progression.

Viremia was related to a broader set of components, most prominently 6 and then secondarily 7, 8, and 9 (Fig. {@fig:import}B). Given the importance of component 6 in predicting nearly all of the functional measurements (Fig. {@fig:import}A), its loss contributing to viremia is to be expected. Components 7 and 8 strongly weighted binding to Nef antigen (Fig. {@fig:import}B). Non-functional variants of Nef have been identified to contribute to early viremic control [@PMID:24965469]. Therefore, Nef binding may be a reflection of its presence and therefore function in subjects, contributing to viremic status. In all, a small number of consistent patterns accurately predict subjects' class of HIV infection status.
