### Systems serology measurements can be drastically reduced without loss of information

We first sought to determine whether recognizing the structure of systems serology measurements could inform better data reduction strategies. To integrate antigen-specific and -generic measurements, we developed an adjusted form of tensor factorization we will refer to as total coupled matrix-tensor factorization (T-CMTF). In contrast to coupled matrix-tensor factorization, we solve for factors that both jointly explain both data structures, as well as ones which explain the variation unique to the matrix [@PMID:31251750]. In doing so, our factors explain the totality of the variation in both data sets. Briefly, we solve for the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition of the tensor, project these factors onto the matrix, and then only decompose the residual variation within the matrix [@DOI:10.1137/07070111X]. Each step is additionally performed iteratively with masking to allow for missing values.

To determine the extent of data reduction possible, we examined the reconstruction error upon decomposition with varying numbers of components (Fig. XXX). As we start with a tensor of 181✖️22✖️41 and matrix of 181✖️25, we start with 167,787 total measurements. 43% of these are missing, meaning that in fact the original dataset contains 96,027 total measurements. After factorization with 6 coupled and 6 matrix-specific components, we are left with four matrices of 181x12, 22x6, 41x6, and 25x6. Therefore, we reduce the dataset by 36-fold to 2,700 numbers, while preserving XX% of its variation (Fig. XXX). This gave us confidence that this structured factorization greatly reduced the data while preserving its meaningful biological patterns.

(J) Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to separate each of the four cell populations by their (K) loadings of TAMR and ligand expression (accounting for localization).](figure1.svg "Figure 1"){#fig:quantFig width="100%"}
