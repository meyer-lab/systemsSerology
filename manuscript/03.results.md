### Systems serology measurements can be drastically reduced without loss of information

We first sought to determine whether recognizing the structure of systems serology measurements could inform better data reduction strategies. To integrate antigen-specific and -generic measurements, we developed an adjusted form of tensor factorization we will refer to as total coupled matrix-tensor factorization (T-CMTF). In contrast to coupled matrix-tensor factorization, we solve for factors that both jointly explain both data structures, as well as ones which explain the variation unique to the matrix [@PMID:31251750]. In doing so, our factors explain the totality of the variation in both data sets. Briefly, we solve for the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition of the tensor, project these factors onto the matrix, and then only decompose the residual variation within the matrix [@DOI:10.1137/07070111X]. Each step is additionally performed iteratively with masking to allow for missing values.

### Structured data decomposition more accurately predicts functional measurements and patient classes

(J) Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to separate each of the four cell populations by their (K) loadings of TAMR and ligand expression (accounting for localization).](figure1.svg "Figure 1"){#fig:quantFig width="100%"}
