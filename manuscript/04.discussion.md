## Discussion

Here, we show that structured data decomposition can improve our view of systems serology measurements.


This occurs through improvements in our ability to predict quantities of interest, such as patient status and immune functional measurements.



At the same time, recognizing the structure of these data improves interpretation of the resulting models.



Challenges still remain in improving our mechanistic view of the underlying molecular processes. For example, in some cases such as ADCC, a panel of FcgRIII measurements predict this functional response. This receptor is known to be the activating FcgR in NK cells, and so one can assume these measurements point to increased FcgRIII binding. However, this observation might be a reflection of increased Fc-FcgRIII affinity, increased antigen affinity, increased antigen binding avidity, or a combination of these factors. In cases such as patient status or more complex functional responses across effector populations, the resulting predictive factors are even more difficult to mechanistically interpret.

Part of this might occur through more expansive characterization of the humoral response. To the extent that structured data decomposition represents consistent patterns in humoral response, additional measurements across diseases might refine the patterns of regulatory changes influencing responses. In some sense, separate diseases only differ in the antigen component of their response, while the receptor-related factors might be shared. With this view, a "transfer learning" approach could be taken to learn the patterns of humoral immunity across diseases and further refine the patterns in receptor binding and how they relate to glycosylation changes. Integrating data-driven and mechanistic models may also improve our ability to distinguish these mechanisms. Even simple biophysical models would improve our ability to link biophysical characterization of molecular components, such as Fc of defined glycosylation, to binding measurements. Doing so, however, will require careful integration of existing knowledge, such as well-characterized Fc-FcgR interactions, with unknown quantities such as variation in antigen properties, the contribution of glycosylation, and unknown regulatory mechanisms. What one can be sure of, from the rich history of humoral immunity, is that better understanding these immune mechanisms will improve our ability to understand and treat disease.
