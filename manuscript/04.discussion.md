## Discussion

We show here that structured data decomposition can improve our view of systems serology measurements. Specifically, this technique recognizes that measurements and their variation take place across distinct dimensions—namely antigen binding versus immune receptor engagement. Using this property, we identify that the dimensionality of these measurements can be reduced more efficiently, can be made robust to missing values, and properties of the immune system can be more accurately predicted. This form of dimensionality reduction further improves interpretation of the resulting models, as it accounts for the high degree of inter-correlation across each dimension.

Challenges still remain in improving our mechanistic view of the underlying molecular processes. For example, in some cases such as ADCC, a panel of FcγRIII measurements predict this functional response. This receptor is known to be the activating FcγR in NK cells, and so one can assume these measurements point to increased FcγRIII binding. However, this observation might be a reflection of increased Fc-FcγRIII affinity, increased antigen affinity, increased antigen binding avidity, or a combination of these factors. In cases such as patient status or more complex functional responses across effector populations, the resulting predictive factors are even more difficult to mechanistically interpret.



While effective dimensionality reduction improves our ability to use these sort of measurements, future advancements are sure to further improve our view of antibody-mediated protection mechanisms. As mentioned above, systems serology in a way provides a view of antibody-mediated immunity akin to the microarray for gene expression data. The analogy reveals a few modeling advancements that will help leverage this data. One valuable property of TMTF is that it separates the immune receptor patterns from antigen binding patterns within the data. As a result, it should be possible to look for common Fc response patterns across diseases, because these different datasets would share this axis. This “transfer learning” could therefore help to identify common patterns of immune dysregulation. With more extensive profiling of the various glycosylation and isotype Fc forms, it would be possible to specify the receptor axis of the decomposition, to match new measurements to specific known immunologic patterns. These pattern-matching approaches would be much like gene expression enrichment analysis for gene expression. Finally, the binding interactions of antibodies, while they produce combinatorial complexity, are a simple set of antigen and receptor binding. Ultimately, it should be possible to apply multivalent binding models to mechanistically model the interactions within serum [@PMID:29960887; @DOI:10.1016/0025-5564(80)90017-6]. Such a mechanistic view would not only allow us to exactly identify mechanisms of antibody-mediated protection, but to provide more advanced therapeutic interventions, like monoclonal inhibitors or enhancers of antibody response that cooperate with the cocktail of endogenous antibodies. 

Advancements outside systems serology will ultimately work alongside these measurements to expand our view of immunity. Much like how systems serology has served to profile antibody-mediated protection, global profiling methods are helping to globally characterize T cell-mediated immunity. These technologies, alongside more traditional technologies to profile cytokine response, gene expression, and other molecular features, promise to provide a truly comprehensive view of immunity. Integrating these data will require dimensionality reduction techniques that recognize the structure of these data alone and in combination. Factorization methods will be a natural solution to this challenge, due to their scalability, flexibility, and interpretability.
