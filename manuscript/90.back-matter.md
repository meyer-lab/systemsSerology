![**Decision boundaries of subject classification.** (A) Viremic and non-viremic decision is mostly dependent on components 2 and 4. (B) Controller and progressor on components 3 and 5.](figureEV1.svg "Figure EV1"){#fig:decision width="100%" tag="EV1"}

![**Demonstrating the instability of Alter et al’s method of elastic net prediction** Plots comparing the generated models of prediction from 3 identical trainings using elastic net, focusing on ADCD prediction (a-c). While one would expect similar models as they are all trained on the same dataset, the models vary significantly with respect to the number of receptors used, and their assigned values.](figureEV2.svg "Figure EV2"){#fig:alterweight width="100%" tag="EV2"}

![**Simple methods for investigating gp120/p24 antigen ratio progression predictions yield different results based on IgG** A) Raw gp120/p24 measurement ratios against IgG, separated by subject class. Lines in boxes indicate median. The boxes show the quartiles of the dataset, while error bars indicate the rest of the distribution. Points indicate outlier points, which are determined by seaborn as a function of the inter-quartile range. B) Controller vs. Progressor prediction accuracy using gp120 and p24 measurements for each IgG. Predictions were done using logistic regression as described in methods. Accuracy is defined as classification accuracy. The prediction results vary based on which IgG is selected.](figureEV3.svg "Figure EV3"){#fig:gpratio width="100%" tag="EV3"}

![**Comparing receptor genotype measurements across shared antigens shows consistent non-linear relationships.** Plots comparing the binding among the FcγRIIa (a–c), FcγRIIIa (d–f), and FcγRIIIb (g–i) receptors, across all shared antigens and subjects. The red line shows the least-squares regression of a power curve. While one would expect sample-by-sample differences due to receptor affinity, the most prominent pattern is a consistent non-linear relationship. Also, the non-genotpe-specific receptor was the most divergent in measurement in every case. This suggests some consistent, technical artifact between the generic and genotype-resolved measurements.](figureEV4.svg "Figure EV4"){#fig:binding width="100%" tag="EV4"}
