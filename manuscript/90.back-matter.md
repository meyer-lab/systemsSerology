![**Gaussian process model predicts antibody effector function from tensor factorization values.** A-D) Accuracy of Gaussian process model built from the subject factors resulting from tensor factorization. Each point represents one subject and values represent antibody effector function assay values from Alter et al 2018. Accuracy score was calculated as the pearson correlation coefficient and red line represents the line of best fit. ](figureS1.svg "Figure S1"){#fig:predS width="100%"}
