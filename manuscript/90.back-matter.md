![**Comparing receptor genotype measurements across shared antigens shows consistent non-linear relationships.** Plots comparing the binding among the FcγRIIa (a–c), FcγRIIIa (d–f), and FcγRIIIb (g–i) receptors, across all shared antigens and subjects. The red line shows the least-squares regression of a power curve. While one would expect sample-by-sample differences due to receptor affinity, the most prominent pattern is a consistent non-linear relationship. Also, the non-genotpe-specific receptor was the most divergent in measurement in every case. This suggests some consistent, technical artifact between the generic and genotype-resolved measurements.](figureEV1.svg "Figure EV1"){#fig:binding width="100%" tag="EV1"}
