![**Predicted versus actual values of factorization-based regression models.** Each point represents one subject and values represent antibody effector function assay values [@DOI:10.15252/msb.20177881]. Accuracy was calculated using the Pearson correlation coefficient. The red line represents the line of best fit.](figureS1.svg "Figure S1"){#fig:predS width="100%" tag="S1"}

![**Comparing receptor genotype measurements across shared antigens shows consistent non-linear relationships.** Plots comparing the binding among the FcγRIIa (a–c), FcγRIIIa (d–f), and FcγRIIIb (g–i) receptors, across all shared antigens and subjects. The red line shows the least-squares regression of a power curve. While one would expect sample-by-sample differences due to receptor affinity, the most prominent pattern is a consistent non-linear relationship. Also, the non-genotpe-specific receptor was the most divergent in measurement in every case. This suggests some consistent, technical artifact between the generic and genotype-resolved measurements.](figureS2.svg "Figure S2"){#fig:binding width="100%" tag="S2"}
