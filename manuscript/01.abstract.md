## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Systems serology measurements provide a comprehensive view of humoral immunity by profiling both the antigen-binding and Fc properties of antibodies. Systems serology studies usually contain structured biophysical profiling across disease-relevant antigen targets, alongside additional non-antigen-specific measurements. Identifying patterns in these measurements will help to guide vaccine and therapeutic antibody development, improve our understanding of disorders, and discover conserved regulatory mechanisms. In order to explore both antigen-dependent and independent measurements more extensively, innovative data-driven methods need to be explored. Here, we report that a new form of tensor factorization, coupled matrix-tensor factorization (CMTF), can greatly reduce these data into consistently observed patterns by recognizing the structure of these data. We use a previous study of HIV-infected subjects as an example. CMTF outperforms standard methods like principal components analysis in the extent of data reduction possible while maintaining equivalently powerful prediction of immune functional responses and classification of subjects based on their HIV control status. Under CMTF, the interpretation of these resulting models is greatly improved, and it can be additionally improved specifically by applying further data reduction, separation of the Fc from antigen-binding effects, and recognizing consistent patterns across individual measurements. Therefore, we propose that CMTF will be an effective general strategy for exploring and using systems serology.

## Summary points
