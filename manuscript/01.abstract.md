## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Systems serology measurements provide a more comprehensive view of humoral immunity by comprehensively profiling both the antigen binding and Fc properties of antibodies. Identifying patterns in these measurements will help to guide vaccine and therapeutic antibody development, alongside improving our understanding of disorders in humoral immunity. Furthermore, consistent patterns across diseases may reflect conserved regulatory mechanisms; recognizing these may help to combine vaccines and other antibody-based interventions with other immunotherapies. A common feature of systems serology studies is structured biophysical profiling across disease-relevant antigen targets, properties of antibodies' interation with the immune system, and serological samples. These are typically produced alongide measurements that are not antigen-specific. Here, we report a new form of tensor factorization, total tensor-matrix factorization (TMTF), which can greatly reduce this data into consistently observed patterns by recognizing the structure of these data. Data reduction improves prediction of immune functional responses, classification of patients based on their HIV-1 control, 

## Summary points

- Structured decomposition provides substantial data reduction without loss of information.
- Predictions based on decomposed factors are more accurate and robust to missing measurements.
- Decomposition structure improves the interpretability of modeling results.
- Decomposed factors represent meaningful patterns in the HIV humoral response.
